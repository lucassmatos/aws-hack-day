    "solution": "I understand how frustrating login issues can be. Let's troubleshoot this step by step: 1) First, ensure you're entering the correct email address - check for typos or extra spaces, 2) Try the 'Forgot Password' link to reset it, even if you think it's correct, 3) Clear your browser cache and cookies or app cache, 4) Try logging in from a different device or browser to rule out device issues, 5) Your account may be locked for security after multiple attempts - wait 30 minutes or contact support. If none of these work, your account may need manual verification."

    "solution": "App crashes are definitely frustrating! Let's fix this for your iPhone 12: 1) First, update to the latest app version in the App Store, 2) Restart your iPhone completely (hold power button, slide to power off), 3) Check that your iOS is 13.0 or higher for compatibility, 4) Delete and reinstall the app for a clean installation, 5) Check Settings > General > iPhone Storage to ensure you have at least 1GB free. If crashes persist after these steps, please report the bug through the app's feedback option with crash details so our team can investigate."

    "problem": "I requested a password reset 3 times but haven't received any emails.",
    "solution": "Missing password reset emails usually have a simple fix. Please check: 1) Your spam/junk folder - reset emails often get filtered there, 2) Make sure you're checking the right email account if you have multiple, 3) Each reset link expires in 1 hour - request a fresh one now, 4) Verify you're entering the exact email address associated with your account, 5) Add noreply@acmerentals.com to your contacts to prevent filtering. If you still don't receive it within 10 minutes, contact support with your account email so we can manually assist with the reset."

    "solution": "Let's get you back into your account! For 2FA issues: 1) Ensure your phone number is entered correctly in your account (including country code), 2) Check if SMS messages are being delayed by your carrier, 3) Try the 'Voice Call' option instead of SMS for the code, 4) If you saved backup codes when setting up 2FA, use one of those, 5) Check if you're in an area with poor cell reception. If you have an authenticator app linked, use that instead. As a last resort, contact support with account verification details to temporarily disable 2FA."

    "solution": "Account locks are frustrating but they're for your protection. Common triggers include: multiple failed login attempts, logging in from new locations/devices, unusual booking patterns, or payment issues. To unlock: 1) Check your email for a security notification with unlock instructions, 2) You may need to verify your identity by answering security questions, 3) Reset your password as a precaution, 4) Enable two-factor authentication for better security, 5) Contact support if you can't self-unlock - have ID ready for verification.

Try these optimization steps: 1) Close all other apps to free up memory, 2) Go to Settings > Apps > Acme > Storage > Clear Cache (not data), 3) Check your internet connection speed, 4) Update to the latest app version in Google Play, 5) In app settings, try lowering image quality for faster loading, 6) Disable battery optimization for Acme app (Settings > Battery > App Battery Management). If still slow, restart your device completely. Older Android devices may need the 'Lite' version of our app for better performance."

    "solution": "Filter issues can be tricky. Let's troubleshoot: 1) We recommend using maximum 5 filters at a time - too many can conflict, 2) Some filter combinations are incompatible (the system should warn you), 3) Make sure to tap 'Apply' or 'Show Results' after setting filters, 4) Price ranges are inclusive - check your min/max values, 5) Try clearing all filters and adding them back one at a time to identify conflicts. Also pull down to refresh results after changing filters. If specific filters consistently fail, note which ones and report to our tech team."

    "solution": "A blank page usually indicates a browser issue. Let's fix this: 1) First, check if it's just our site - visit other websites to test your connection, 2) Try a different browser (Chrome, Safari, Firefox, or Edge), 3) Clear your browser cache and cookies for acmerentals.com, 4) Disable browser extensions, especially ad blockers, which can interfere, 5) Try loading in incognito/private browsing mode.

Try these fixes: 1) Enable location services for Acme app in your device settings, 2) Zoom in and out on the map to trigger a refresh, 3) Click 'Redo search in area' button after moving the map, 4) Switch between map and list view to reset the display, 5) Check your internet connection - maps require good data speed. Sometimes clearing the app cache helps with map rendering. Note that GPS accuracy varies by device and location. If indoor, try near a window for better GPS signal."

Try these solutions: 1) Check your internet connection - switch between WiFi and cellular data, 2) Pull down to refresh the conversation, 3) Check if the recipient hasn't blocked you (rare but possible), 4) Ensure your message is within character limits and contains no prohibited content, 5) Force close the app and reopen to reset the connection. If a specific message is stuck, try copying the text, deleting the stuck message, and sending again. Sometimes server delays cause this - messages often send after a few minutes."

    "problem": "My saved payment methods disappeared. I have to re-enter cards every time!",
    "solution": "Disappearing payment methods are often a security feature, not a bug: 1) After 90 days of inactivity, we remove saved cards for security, 2) Make sure you're logged into the correct account, 3) Check if your payment method expired - expired cards are auto-removed, 4) Some security software blocks payment storage, 5) Re-add your payment method and check 'Save for future use'. For added convenience, consider using digital wallets like Apple Pay or Google Pay which don't expire. This security measure protects you from unauthorized use of stored payment methods."

Let's fix this immediately: 1) Check that your calendar URLs haven't changed - regenerate them if needed, 2) Verify two-way sync is enabled in both platforms, 3) Normal sync delay is 15 minutes - immediate updates aren't expected, 4) Manually refresh the sync in your calendar settings, 5) Make sure the calendar URLs are correctly pasted without extra spaces. If sync is broken, temporarily block dates manually on both platforms until fixed. Some users find third-party sync tools more reliable for managing multiple platforms."

    "solution": "Photo upload crashes are often related to file sizes or formats. Here's the fix: 1) Reduce photo file sizes - most phones take huge photos that can crash apps, 2) Upload one photo at a time instead of multiple, 3) Ensure photos are in JPEG or PNG format, not HEIC or RAW, 4) Check available storage on your device, 5) Try uploading through the website instead of the app. If using iPhone, go to Settings > Camera > Formats > Most Compatible.

Never enter payment info if the padlock is missing or broken. Legitimate Acme emails only come from @acmerentals.com domain.

Here's what's happening: 1) Ensure you're logged in - wishlists don't save for guest browsing, 2) Check your internet connection when saving - poor connection may fail to sync, 3) Pull down to refresh your wishlist page, 4) Wishlists are device-specific if not logged in, 5) Properties may be removed by hosts and disappear from wishlists.

    "problem": "Low bandwidth mode doesn't actually reduce data usage. Still eating my data plan!",
    "solution": "Data saving features should actually save data: 1) Low bandwidth mode mainly reduces image quality - check if enabled properly, 2) Video previews might still autoplay - disable in settings, 3) Map views use significant data - use list view instead, 4) Background refresh might still run - disable it, 5) Check your device's data usage breakdown for the app. Monitor before/after enabling data saver to verify effectiveness. If no difference, report this bug. Meanwhile, use mobile website with images disabled in browser for true low-data browsing."

    "problem": "Haptic feedback is way too strong. Phone buzzes aggressively for every tap!",
    "solution": "Excessive haptic feedback is jarring: 1) Check app settings for haptic feedback intensity options, 2) Your device settings might amplify haptics - check system preferences, 3) Some Android phones have aggressive defaults - reduce system-wide, 4) iOS: Settings > Sounds & Haptics > System Haptics, 5) If no app control exists, report this as needed feature. Haptic feedback should be subtle confirmation, not jarring. Some users disable it entirely for battery savings. We should provide granular control over feedback intensity."

    "problem": "Split screen mode is broken on iPad. App doesn't resize properly.",
    "solution": "iPad multitasking should work smoothly: 1) Ensure iPad OS is updated for best compatibility, 2) Try different split ratios - some work better than others, 3) Force-quit and reopen app in split screen mode, 4) Check if app has iPad-specific version installed, 5) Some features may not support split screen yet. Report which orientations and split ratios break with screenshots. Workaround: use slide-over instead of split screen, or use Safari for booking while app shows property details. iPad optimization is ongoing."

    "problem": "Offline mode doesn't save anything. Loses all work when connection returns!",
    "solution": "Offline capability should preserve your work: 1) Ensure offline mode is actually enabled in settings, 2) Some actions can't be saved offline (payments, bookings), 3) Check if app has permission to store local data, 4) Force-sync when connection returns by pulling down, 5) Screenshot important info while offline as backup. True offline support is limited - mainly for viewing saved properties. For reliability: complete important actions only when connected, use screenshot backup method, or copy important text elsewhere. Report which specific actions lose data when reconnecting."

    "solution": "Widgets should provide quick useful information: 1) Remove and re-add widget to refresh authentication, 2) Ensure you're logged into the app recently, 3) Widgets need background refresh enabled to update, 4) iOS 14+ or Android 12+ required for widgets, 5) Try different widget sizes - some are more reliable. If widget consistently errors, the feature might be broken in current version. Report with OS version and widget size. Alternative: use app shortcuts for quick access instead of broken widgets."

    "problem": "Password requirements are insane! Can't create one that meets all rules.",
    "solution": "Complex password requirements need clear guidance: 1) Typical requirements: 8+ characters, uppercase, lowercase, number, special character, 2) Avoid common patterns like 'Password123!', 3) No spaces at beginning or end, 4) Can't reuse recent passwords, 5) Try a passphrase like 'Coffee@Beach2024!'. Use a password manager to generate and store complex passwords. If requirements seem impossible or keep changing, screenshot the rules and report the bug. Security is important but requirements should be achievable."

    "problem": "Tab order is wrong. Hitting tab jumps randomly around the form!",
    "solution": "Proper tab order is crucial for keyboard navigation: 1) This is an accessibility bug we need to fix, 2) Try clicking directly instead of tabbing for now, 3) Report specific forms with bad tab order, 4) Mobile keyboards might have different tab behavior, 5) Some browser extensions interfere with tab order. For efficiency, use mouse/touch while we fix this. This particularly affects users who rely on keyboard navigation. Email accessibility@acmerentals.com with specific forms affected - this is high priority for us to fix."

    "problem": "Confirmation codes expire too fast. Can't type 6 digits in 30 seconds!",
    "solution": "Short code expiration is frustrating: 1) Copy/paste the code if possible instead of typing, 2) Have the code screen ready before requesting, 3) Request new code if expired - don't rush and mistype, 4) Voice call option might give more time, 5) Check if keyboard is slowing you down on mobile. 30 seconds should be sufficient for 6 digits, but we understand difficulties. Report if codes consistently expire too fast. Consider using authenticator app instead of SMS for more reliable codes without expiration pressure."

    "solution": "Unwanted translation creates communication barriers: 1) Check your listing language settings in host dashboard, 2) Disable automatic translation for your listings, 3) Specify supported languages clearly in description, 4) Update listing to trigger re-indexing in correct language, 5) Report incorrect automatic translations. For current foreign inquiries: use translation tools to explain language limitations politely. Set your listing to specific language rather than 'auto-detect'. We're improving translation accuracy, but host control over listing language is important."

    "problem": "Recent update killed battery life. Phone dies in 2 hours with app installed!",
    "solution": "Severe battery drain after updates needs immediate fix: 1) Check Settings > Battery for detailed app usage stats, 2) Disable all background features temporarily, 3) Report issue with version number and device model, 4) Downgrade to previous version if possible (Android only), 5) Uninstall until fix is released if critical. This is unacceptable - apps shouldn't kill batteries. We likely have a runaway background process. Your battery life matters and we'll issue emergency fix. Meanwhile, use mobile website to avoid the battery-draining app version."

    "problem": "Gesture navigation conflicts with app. Keep accidentally going back/closing!",
    "solution": "Modern gesture navigation can conflict with app gestures: 1) Adjust gesture sensitivity in device settings, 2) Use gesture hints/bars instead of full gesture mode, 3) Learn the 'peek and hold' gesture to cancel accidental backs, 4) Some apps have gesture zones - avoid edges, 5) Report specific gesture conflicts for fixes. Android: Settings > System > Gestures. iOS: Settings > Accessibility > Touch. We're updating the app to better handle system gestures, but device-level adjustments help immediately."

    "solution": "Accessibility font scaling should work properly: 1) We're working on better dynamic type support, 2) Try medium text size as compromise for now, 3) Use zoom instead of largest text sizes temporarily, 4) Report specific screens that break with large text, 5) Website might handle text scaling better than app. This is an accessibility failure we take seriously. Email accessibility@acmerentals.com with screenshots of broken layouts. Everyone should be able to use their preferred text size. We'll prioritize fixing dynamic type support."

Some ISPs route traffic strangely, causing geolocation errors. For immediate fix, always search by entering city name rather than using 'Near me'. Report consistent wrong location detection with your actual location and detected location."

This is often an iOS bug rather than our app. If persists after iOS update, report with crash logs. Alternative sharing: copy link manually or use the web version for sharing."

Older devices may not support AR features. If your device should support AR but crashes, report with device model. Alternative: use 360-degree photos for immersive viewing without AR requirements."

This is a critical safety feature - if broken, report immediately to tech@acmerentals.com. As backup: save emergency numbers in your phone contacts, share trip details with trusted contacts manually, and know local emergency numbers for your destination. Your safety is paramount!"
