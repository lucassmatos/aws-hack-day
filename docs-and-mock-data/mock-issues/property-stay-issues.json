    "problem": "I arrived at the cabin but haven't received the door code. It's 5 PM and I'm locked out!",
    "solution": "I understand how frustrating it is to be locked out! Check-in instructions are automatically sent 48 hours before arrival. Let's get you inside: 1) First, check your email (including spam folder) for check-in instructions, 2) Open the app and go to 'Your Trips' - instructions should be there, 3) Use the 'Contact Host' button for immediate help, 4) If the host doesn't respond within 30 minutes, call our emergency line at 1-800-HELP-NOW. We'll get you access immediately. This is considered an emergency situation and we'll ensure you get into your cabin right away."

    "problem": "Can we check in at noon instead of 3 PM? We're arriving early from a long drive.",
    "solution": "Early check-in is often possible with host approval! Standard check-in is 3 PM, but many hosts accommodate when they can. Here's how to request: 1) Message your host through the app as soon as possible, 2) Explain your situation and arrival time, 3) Some hosts offer early check-in for a small fee, 4) Self-check-in properties often have more flexibility. If the cabin isn't ready, hosts might offer luggage storage or recommend nearby activities. The key is communicating early - hosts appreciate advance notice and often try to accommodate reasonable requests."

    "solution": "No heat in winter is an EMERGENCY! Take immediate action: 1) First, check the thermostat settings and manual, ensure it's on 'heat' mode, 2) Check if there's a circuit breaker labeled for HVAC, 3) Look for space heaters as temporary solution, 4) Contact the host immediately AND call our emergency line at 1-800-HELP-NOW.

    "solution": "I understand this is very disappointing - the property should match its listing. This qualifies as a listing discrepancy. Take these steps: 1) Take photos of the actual view versus listing photos, 2) Report this within 24 hours of arrival (critical timeline), 3) Document the discrepancy in detail. You have several options: request partial refund for the misrepresentation, full refund if you choose to leave, or future stay credit. Natural features can change seasonally, but hosts must keep listings current. We take misrepresentation seriously and will work toward fair compensation."

    "solution": "Let's troubleshoot the WiFi issue: 1) First, check the router location and confirm you have the correct password, 2) Try power cycling the router - unplug for 30 seconds then plug back in, 3) Verify WiFi was listed as an amenity in the booking. If it was advertised and still not working: contact the host for advanced troubleshooting or replacement, they may have a backup hotspot available. If WiFi was specifically advertised but can't be fixed, you may be eligible for compensation. However, if WiFi wasn't listed as an amenity, no compensation is available."

    "problem": "There's a bear on the deck and we're afraid to go outside! What do we do?",
    "solution": "Wildlife encounters are common in cabin settings. For your safety: 1) Stay inside and keep all doors and windows locked, 2) Do NOT attempt to feed or approach the bear, 3) Make noise from inside to encourage it to leave, 4) Ensure all food is secured inside, 5) Contact the host for local wildlife guidance. Bears typically leave on their own. If the bear appears aggressive or won't leave after an hour, contact local wildlife authorities (host should have numbers). Follow all host wildlife guidelines. This is a natural occurrence in cabin areas, not a property defect."

    "solution": "A non-functioning hot tub when it's a key amenity is a significant issue. Here's what to do: 1) Take photos of the hot tub condition, 2) Check if it's listed as a seasonal amenity (some close in certain months), 3) Verify you followed any operating instructions, 4) Report to the host immediately. Since you specifically booked for this amenity, you're entitled to compensation. Options include: partial refund for the unusable amenity, host arranging immediate maintenance, or future stay credit.

Take these steps: 1) First check power and settings - ensure it's plugged in and breakers are on, 2) Look for instruction manuals in kitchen drawers, 3) Try all burners and oven to identify what specifically isn't working, 4) Report to host immediately with details. Since cooking was planned, you're entitled to compensation. Options include: host providing alternative cooking equipment (hot plates, grills), partial refund for the unusable kitchen, or reimbursement for having to eat out.

    "solution": "Late checkout is often available with host approval. Standard checkout is 11 AM, but here's how to request 1 PM: 1) Message your host through the app as early as possible, 2) Explain your flight schedule to provide context, 3) Many hosts accommodate 1-2 hour extensions, sometimes free or for a small fee, 4) Depends on whether they have same-day arrivals. If approved, get confirmation in writing through the app. If not possible, hosts often allow luggage storage while you wait for your flight. Early communication increases your chances of approval."

You're entitled to: relocation to a property with correct bedrooms, significant partial refund if you choose to stay, or full refund if you leave.

Most hosts understand the urgency of medication and will ship immediately. You'll cover shipping costs, but hosts typically help quickly with medical items.

Here's what to do: 1) Try calling/knocking at the neighbor's again, 2) Contact your host immediately through the app, 3) Ask if there's a backup key location or different neighbor, 4) If host doesn't respond within 30 minutes, call Acme emergency support at 1-800-HELP-NOW.

Here's the proper process: 1) Take photos of the broken lamp immediately, 2) Report to the host right away through the app with photos, 3) Explain it was accidental, 4) Offer to pay for reasonable replacement cost. Accidental damage is typically covered by Acme's protection plan for normal wear and tear. For a lamp, you'd usually pay actual replacement cost (not inflated prices).

Here's what's actually expected: 1) Basic tidiness - dishes in dishwasher, garbage in bins, 2) Personal items removed, 3) Follow specific instructions like stripping beds IF requested, 4) You're NOT required to vacuum, mop, clean bathrooms, or do deep cleaning. That's what the cleaning fee covers. If hosts demand extensive cleaning: document their requirements, take photos of how you left the property, and report excessive demands to Acme.
