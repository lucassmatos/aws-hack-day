      "problem": "I tried to book a cabin for next weekend but my payment went through and I never received a confirmation email. The dates are now showing as unavailable but I don't have a booking in my account.",
      "solution": "I can see your payment was processed successfully. There was a technical delay in creating your reservation. I've manually confirmed your booking #ACM-789012 for the Riverside Cabin from March 15-17. You'll receive your confirmation email within the next hour with check-in details. The booking is now visible in your trips section."

      "problem": "I need to change my reservation dates from this Friday to next Friday but the system won't let me modify my booking.",
      "solution": "I've checked your booking and the property has a strict modification policy within 7 days of check-in. However, I can help you contact the host directly to request the date change. If they approve, we'll waive the modification fee. Alternatively, you can cancel (50% refund applies) and rebook for your preferred dates."

      "problem": "I accidentally booked the wrong cabin - I meant to book the Mountain View Cabin but booked the Lake View Cabin instead. Can you help me switch?",
      "solution": "I understand the confusion. Since you booked within the last hour, I can process a full refund for the Lake View Cabin. The Mountain View Cabin is still available for your dates. Would you like me to cancel your current booking and you can immediately book the correct cabin? The refund will process in 5-10 business days."

      "problem": "I'm trying to book a cabin for 8 people but it only shows options for 6 people maximum. We're a large family group.",
      "solution": "For groups larger than 6, you'll need to adjust the guest count filter in your search. Click 'More Filters' and increase the guest count to 8. This will show cabins that accommodate larger groups. Alternatively, you might consider booking two nearby cabins. I can help you find properties close to each other if you'd prefer that option."

      "problem": "The host hasn't responded to my booking request and it's been over 24 hours. What happens now?",
      "solution": "I apologize for the delay. When hosts don't respond within 24 hours, the request automatically expires and no payment is processed. You're free to book another property immediately. As compensation for the inconvenience, I'm adding a $50 credit to your account for your next booking. The host has been notified about their missed response."

      "problem": "I need to cancel my booking due to a family emergency but the cancellation policy says no refund. Is there anything you can do?",
      "solution": "I'm sorry to hear about your emergency. While the standard cancellation policy applies, we can offer you a few options: 1) A credit for 100% of your booking value valid for 12 months, 2) The ability to transfer the booking to someone else, or 3) I can reach out to the host to request an exception. Many hosts are understanding about genuine emergencies. Which would you prefer?"

      "category": "Booking & Reservation Issues",
      "problem": "I made a booking but realized I selected the wrong check-in date. I need to arrive one day earlier. Can this be fixed?",
      "solution": "I've checked the calendar and good news - the cabin is available for the night before your current check-in date. I can modify your reservation to add the extra night for $125. This would change your check-in from March 20 to March 19. The same cancellation policy will apply to the entire stay. Shall I proceed with this modification?"

      "category": "Booking & Reservation Issues",
      "problem": "The cabin I want to book shows available on the calendar but when I try to book it says the dates are not available.",
      "solution": "This usually happens when another guest is currently in the process of booking the same dates. The calendar updates every 15 minutes, so there can be a brief delay. I'd recommend either: 1) Trying again in 20 minutes, 2) Selecting alternate dates, or 3) Turning on availability alerts for this property so you'll be notified immediately when your dates become available."

      "problem": "I have an Acme+ membership but the 10% discount didn't apply to my booking.",
      "solution": "I see the issue - your Acme+ membership expired 3 days before you made this booking. However, since you've been a loyal member, I'm applying the discount retroactively. You'll see a refund of $67.50 (10% of your booking) within 5-10 business days. I've also sent you a renewal link with a 20% discount on your next year's membership."

      "solution": "I found your reservation! It was booked under your other email address (j.smith@email.com instead of john.smith@email.com). I've now linked both email addresses to your account so you can see all your bookings in one place. Your reservation #ACM-456789 for Pine Ridge Cabin March 22-25 is confirmed and I'm resending your check-in details now."

      "problem": "My credit card was charged twice for the same booking. I see two identical charges on my statement.",
      "solution": "I see both charges in our system. The first one is the actual charge, and the second is a temporary authorization that will automatically drop off within 3-5 business days. This sometimes happens when there's a brief connection issue during payment. If the second charge actually posts to your account (not just pending), please let us know and we'll issue an immediate refund."

      "solution": "I've located your refund of $234.50 which was processed on March 1st to your Visa ending in 4567. Sometimes banks take up to 15 business days to show refunds. I'm issuing a trace request with our payment processor and sending you a refund confirmation email with a reference number you can provide to your bank to expedite the credit."

      "problem": "I'm trying to pay for a booking but it keeps declining my card. I know the card is good because I just used it elsewhere.",
      "solution": "International transactions are sometimes blocked by banks as a security measure. Please try: 1) Call your bank to authorize the transaction, 2) Try a different payment method, or 3) Use PayPal which often bypasses these blocks. I can also hold this booking for 2 hours at the current price while you sort out the payment issue."

      "problem": "The price jumped by $100 between when I first looked at the cabin and when I went to book it an hour later.",
      "solution": "I see the price change in our system. This cabin uses dynamic pricing which can fluctuate based on demand. However, since you're a returning customer and the change was significant, I'm able to offer you a $75 credit toward this booking, bringing it closer to the original price you saw. Would you like me to apply this discount?"

      "problem": "I have Acme+ membership but I'm still being charged service fees on my booking.",
      "solution": "You're correct that Acme+ members get service fees waived on 5 bookings per year. I checked and you've already used your 5 fee-free bookings this membership year. Your membership renews on April 1st, when you'll get 5 more fee-free bookings. As a courtesy, I'm refunding this service fee of $45 as a one-time exception."

      "solution": "I can help with that. I'll generate a detailed invoice with all required business information. Please provide: 1) Company name, 2) Tax ID/VAT number, 3) Billing address, 4) Any PO number needed. I'll email the formal invoice within the hour. For future bookings, consider setting up an Acme Business account for streamlined corporate billing."

      "problem": "I want to split the payment for our group booking between 3 different credit cards but I don't see that option.",
      "solution": "Our split payment feature is available at checkout. On the payment page, look for 'Split with travel companions' below the credit card fields. You can add up to 5 different payment methods. Each person will receive their own receipt. If you've already booked, I can cancel and hold the dates for 30 minutes while you rebook with split payment."

      "problem": "I was charged a security deposit but I left the cabin in perfect condition 2 weeks ago and haven't gotten it back.",
      "solution": "Security deposits typically release automatically 14 days after checkout. I see yours was held on March 1st and should have been released yesterday. I'm manually releasing it now - you'll see it back on your card within 3-5 business days. I've also added a note to your account to expedite future deposit releases to 7 days."

      "category": "Payment & Billing Issues",
      "problem": "My Acme+ subscription renewed automatically but I wanted to cancel it. Can I get a refund?",
      "solution": "Since your Acme+ renewed just 5 days ago and you haven't used any benefits yet this period, I can process a full refund of $99. The refund will appear in 5-10 business days and your Acme+ benefits will end immediately. I've also turned off auto-renewal so this won't happen again. Would you like to proceed with the cancellation?"

      "problem": "The cleaning fee wasn't shown when I searched but then $150 was added at checkout. This seems like a hidden fee.",
      "solution": "You're right that cleaning fees should be transparent. There's a toggle in search filters called 'Display total price' which includes all fees upfront. I understand the frustration of unexpected costs. As a goodwill gesture, I'm providing a $75 credit to offset half the cleaning fee. I've also sent feedback to improve fee visibility in search results."

You have several options: 1) Full refund and we'll help relocate you, 2) Stay and receive a 30% refund for the missing amenity, or 3) We can arrange access to a nearby property's hot tub. I'm also flagging this listing for immediate review. What would you prefer? I'll implement your choice right away."

      "solution": "I understand how frustrating this is. I'm immediately reaching out to the host through all emergency channels. While I do that, I've found 2 available cabins within 10 minutes of your location. I can book either one for you at no additional cost. If we can't reach the host within 30 minutes, I'll process a full refund and cover your first night at an alternative property."

Here's what I can do immediately: 1) I'm contacting the host to troubleshoot the WiFi issue, 2) I can provide a $50 credit for you to purchase a mobile hotspot for your stay, 3) If this doesn't resolve it, I'll authorize a 25% refund for the amenity issue. The host has 2 hours to fix this or face penalties."

I'm immediately: 1) Calling local emergency maintenance to arrive within the hour, 2) Authorizing purchase of space heaters up to $200 (keep receipts), 3) If heat isn't restored within 2 hours, I have a heated cabin 5 minutes away ready for your family. Full refund available if you choose to leave."

I'm taking immediate action: 1) Full refund is approved, 2) I've found 3 alternative properties nearby with immediate availability, 3) We'll cover the difference in price for any of these options, 4) The host will be investigated for property standards.

Options: 1) 40% refund and continue your stay, 2) Full refund and relocation assistance, or 3) We can upgrade you to an actual lakefront property at no additional cost (based on availability).

Here's what I can do: 1) I'm sending an emergency message to the host requiring immediate response, 2) You can contact local authorities for noise complaints, 3) I'm authorizing a 25% refund for the disturbance, 4) If this continues tomorrow, we'll relocate you at no cost.

I see the guest checked out on March 5th and your payout of $1,847 was initiated on March 7th but failed due to outdated bank information.

I'm removing their review and they'll be warned about policy violations. Your rating will be recalculated without this review within 24 hours.

      "solution": "I see the issue - your phone number was incorrectly formatted in our system (+1 was missing). I've corrected it. For immediate access, I'm temporarily switching your 2FA to email-based. Check your email for a verification code. Once you're logged in, you can update your phone number in Security Settings and re-enable SMS-based 2FA. I've also generated 5 backup codes for you."

      "solution": "The map feature requires location permissions and certain browser settings. Please: 1) Enable location services for Acme in your device settings, 2) Allow third-party cookies for map functionality, 3) Disable any ad blockers for acmerentals.com, 4) Try a different browser. If still blank, switch to list view temporarily - the map server is undergoing maintenance until 6 PM EST."

      "solution": "The upload is failing due to file size limits (max 10MB). Please: 1) Take photos in good lighting but not highest resolution, 2) Use JPG format, not HEIC, 3) Ensure file is under 10MB. Alternatively, I can manually verify you if you email the documents to verify@acmerentals.com with reference #VER-78234. I'll process it within 2 hours so you can book."

      "solution": "Error 500 typically indicates a server issue, but I see our servers are operational. This is likely a regional CDN problem. Please try: 1) Access via mobile data instead of WiFi, 2) Use our mobile app instead, 3) Try acmerentals.com/mobile for a lightweight version. I'm also escalating this to our infrastructure team to check your region's servers. Can you access it now?"
